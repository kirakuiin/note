**like** 可以在 **looks/sounds/feels**词后表达某人某事如何的含义。此时可以用**as if / as though**进行替换，含义一致，不过更加正式一点。

> [!example]
> That house looks like it's going to fall down.
> That house looks as if it's going to fall down.

> [!hint]
> **like**后一般接 subject + verb。

也可以用**it looks like / sounds like ...**，或**it looks as if / as though**。

> [!example]
> It looks as though she isn't coming.
> It looks like she isn't coming.

在其他动词后用**like, as if , as though**表达某人如何做某事的含义。

> [!example]
> He ran like he was running for his life.

**as if / as though**后有时可以用过去时表现在。我们用这样的形式来表达某事不是真的，参考[[Subjunctive mood]]。

> [!example]
> She's always asking me to do things for her. as if I didn't have enough to do already.
