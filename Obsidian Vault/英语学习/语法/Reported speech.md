当转述别人说的话时，有两种表达方式。直接引语和间接引语。

- 直接引语：Paul said 'I'm feeling ill'.
- 间接引语：Paul said that he was feeling ill.

当使用间接引语时，主动词一般是过去时的，句子的其他部分也是过去时。

> [!example]
> I told Lisa I didn't have any money.

如果描述的事是一般过去时，则间接引语可以保持相同的时态，也可以改为过去完成时。

> [!example]
> Paul said 'I woke up feeling ill', so I didn't go to work.
> Paul said that he woke up feeling ill, so he didn't go to work.
> Paul said that he had woken up feeling ill, so he hadn't gone to work.

如果转述的事情没有发生变化，则可以选择不改变动词时态。如果事情真实情况和你转述的有区别，那么需要用过去时态。

> [!example]
> Paul said that his new job is boring. (His job is still boring now.)

> [!hint] **that**可以被省略

> [!summary] say and tell
> 如果你表达某人在和谁说话，使用**tell**，其他情况使用**say**。
> > [!example]
> > What did you tell the police?
> > What did you say?
> 
> **say**可以用于**say something to somebody**句式。
> > [!example]
> > Ann said goodbye to me and left.

> [!summary] tell/ask somebody to do sth.
> 我们也会在间接引语中使用不定式，尤其是使用**tell**和**ask**时。
> > [!example]
> > 'Can you help me, please,' Jackie said to me.
> > Jackie asked me to help.
> 
> 你也可以说：**somebody said (not) to do sth.**
> > [!example]
> > Paul said not to worry about him.
