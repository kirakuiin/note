有一些副词一般会跟随动词一起出现，比如**always，also，probably**等。它们具有如下规律。

- 如果动词只有一个(**drives/fell**)，那么一般出现在动词之前。
> [!example]
> Lucy hardly ever watches television.
- 如果动词是**be**动词，则一般位于其后。
> [!example]
> The traffic isn't usually as bad as it was this morning.
* 如果动词是**have to**，则位于之前。
> [!example]
> I always have to phone him.
* 如果动词有两个或更多，则一般位于第一个动词之后。
> [!example]
> You've always been very kind to me.
> Do you still work for same company?
* 我们有时会用**is/will/did**等词来省略重复，此时要将其放置到动词前。
> [!example]
> I've never done it and I never will.

> [!hint]
> **both, all**也适用和上面一样的规则。
> > [!example]
> > We are all going out tonight.
> > We all felt ill after the meal.
> 

> [!hint]
> **probably**如果用于否定句，则要位于否定之前。
> > [!example]
> > I probably won't see you.
