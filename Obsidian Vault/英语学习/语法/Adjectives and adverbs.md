形容词告诉我们关于某个名词的性质，我们一般将其放到名词前。

> [!example]
> Sam is a careful driver.

> [!hint]
> 形容词也可以用在动词后，尤其是**be**和**look/feel/sound**等词汇。
> > [!example]
> > Please be quiet.

副词一般告诉我们关于动词的性质，比如某人如何做某事，某事如何发生。

> [!example]
> Same drove carefully along the narrow road.

> [!hint]
> 很多副词一般为对应的形容词+**ly**。但不是所有以**ly**结尾的都是副词。
> > [!example]
> > quick -> quickly
> > quiet -> quietly

副词也可以位于过去分词，形容词和其他副词之后。

> [!example]
> The meeting was badly organized.
> The exam was surprisingly easy.
> Maria learns languages incredibly quickly.

> > I'm very well.
>
> **well**经常同过去分词连用，比如**well-known, well-paid**等。
> > [!example]
> > Gary's father is a well-known writer.

> [!summary] fast/hard/late
> 这三个词既是形容词，也是副词。
> > [!example]
> > I was late.
