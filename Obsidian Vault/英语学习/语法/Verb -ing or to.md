以下是两者均可但含义不同的：

> - **I remember doing sth** = 我做过此事并且我现在还记得。
> - **I remembered to do sth** = 因为必须要做某事，所以我做了此事。
> > [!example]

以下是两者均可且含义类似的。
**begin start continue intend bother**

> [!example]
> It started raining.
> It started to rain.

> [!hint]
> 通常不会在 **-ing**形态后使用**ing**。
> > [!example]
> > It is starting to rain.

在**like/love/hate**后，如果谈论的是重复性的动作，后面可以用 **-ing**或**to do**。 

> [!example]
> Do you like getting up early?
> Do you like to get up early?

但如果你谈论的是某种已经存在的或过去存在的情况时，只能用**ing**。

> [!example]
> Do you like being a student? (You are a student - do you like it?)

> [!hint] like to do 和 like doing的区别
> **I like doing sth** = 我做某事并喜欢做。
> **I like to do sth** = 我认为做这件事是好的，但我不一定喜欢这样做，表达了习惯和选择。
> > [!example]
> > I like cleaning the kitchen. (I enjoy it)
> > It's not my favorite, but I like to the kitchen as often as possible.
>
> > [!warning]
> > 否定时只可以用**ing**形式。

**would like/love/hate/prefer**一般后面都跟随**to**。

> [!example]
> I would like to go away for a few days.

> [!hint] to have done sth
> **would like to have done sth** = 现在感到后悔，因为之前没做某事或没能做某事。**love prefer hate**同理。

**would mind**后只接**ing**。

> [!example]
> Would you mind closing the door, please?
