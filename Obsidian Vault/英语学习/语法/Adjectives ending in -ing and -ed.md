很多形容词以**ing**和**ed**结尾，它们之间的意思有一定的区别。以**bored**和**boring**举例，某人感觉**bored**因为某事**boring**。

> [!example]
> Jane is bored because her job is boring.
> Jane's job is boring, so Jane is bored.

> [!hint]
> 如果形容某人**boring**，那么意思是他让其他人感到**bored**。
> > [!example]
> > George always talks about the same things. He's really boring.

对比以下形容词：

|  |  |
| ---- | ---- |
|  | boring |
|  | interesting |
| my job is | tiring |
|  | satisfying |
|  | depressing |

**ing**形容词形容的的都是某事本身的性质。

I'm not interested in my job any more.
My job makes me depressed.

**ed**形容词形容的都是自身的感受。
