**must**表示你坚信某事是确定的，而**can't**则表示你坚信某事是不可能的。这俩是一对反义词。

> [!example]
> You've been traveling all day. You must be tired.
> You've just had lunch. You can't be hungry.

一般的语法结构为：

|      |            |                        |
| ---- | ---------- | ---------------------- |
|      |            | be (tired/hungry etc.) |
| I/he | must/can't | be (doing/going etc.)  |
|      |            | do/get etc.            |

> I've lost one of my gloves. I must have dropped it somewhere.
> Sarah hasn't contacted me. She can't have got my message.
