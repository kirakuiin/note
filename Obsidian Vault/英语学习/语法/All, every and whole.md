**all** 不等于 **everybody/everyone**。**all**对人使用一般为**all of us / all of you / all of them**。

> [!example]
> All of us had a great time at the party.

---

有时**all**和**everything**意思是差不多的。但**all**后面要接一些结构，比如**all you need / all her life**等；也可以是**all about**，但不能单独用。

> [!example]
> I'll do all I can to help.
> I'll do everything I can to help.
> Everything went wrong.
> He knows all about computer.

> [!hint]
> **all**可以表达唯一的事的含义。
> > [!example]
> > All I've eaten today is a sandwich.

---

**every / everybody / everyone / everything**都是单数，所有后面使用单数动词。但是**everybody / everyone**后面如果有人称代词要用复数形态，比如**them/they/their**。

> [!example]
> Everybody has arrived.
> Everybody said they enjoyed themselves.

---

**whole** = 完全的，整个的。一般用于单数名词。如果有**the/my/her etc**，**whole**要放在其后。

> [!example]
> Emily has lived her whole life in the same town.
> Emily has lived all her life in the same town.

> [!hint]
> 对于不可数名词，一般使用**all**。
> > [!example]
> > I've spent all the money you gave me.

---

**every** + 时间词 = 某事发生的频率。

> [!example]
> The bus service is excellent. There's a bus every ten minutes.

**all / the whole** + 时间词 = 从开始到结束的整个周期。

> [!example]
> We spent all day on the beach.
> We spent the whole day on the beach.

> [!hint]
> **all the time**意为总是，持续的。
> > [!example]
> > They never go out. They are at home all the time.
