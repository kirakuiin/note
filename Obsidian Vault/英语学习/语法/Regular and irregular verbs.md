动词有两种类型：规则动词和不规则动词，这里的规则指的是动词在变为过去式和过去分词时是否遵照一定的规律，如果遵照就是规则动词，不遵照就是不规则动词。

# 规则动词

是指过去式和过去分词仅需要在原型后追加一个*ed*结尾：

| infinitive | past simple | past participle |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| clean      | cleaned     | cleaned         |
| use        | used        | used            |

# 不规则动词

是指过去式和过去分词不以*ed*结尾：

| infinitive | past simple | past participle |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------------- |
| hit        | hit         | hit             |
| tell       | told        | told            |
| wake       | woke        | woken           | 

下表列出所有的不规则动词：
