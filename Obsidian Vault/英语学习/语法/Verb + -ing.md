有些动词后面动词要使用ing形式 **(verb + (not) + -ing)**，如：
**enjoy mind suggest stop postpone admit avoid imagine finish consider deny risk fancy**

> [!example]
> Suddenly everybody stopped talking. There was silence.
> They said they were innocent. They denied doing anything wrong.

有些短语后也要使用ing形式：
- **give up**(stop)
- **put off**(postpone)
- **go on/carry on**(continue)
- **keep/keep on**(do something repeatedly)

> [!example]
> I've given up reading newspapers. I think it's a waste of time.

某些动词可以使用结构**verb + somebody + -ing**。其被动形态为：**being done**。

> [!example]
> I can't imagine George riding a motorbike.
> I don't mind being kept waiting.

在**suggest admit deny**后，你也可以使用**that**从句。

> [!example]
> They denied that the had stolen the money. (They denied stealing)
