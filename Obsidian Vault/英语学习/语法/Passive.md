主动语态强调的是主语做了什么；**被动语态**强调主语发生了什么，至于谁导致了事情发生一般是未知或者是不重要的。

从构成上来看被动语态的主语是其对应的主动语态的宾语。

> The information was given to the police.

常见的动词有：
**ask offer pay show teach tell give**

**get**可以在被动语态中替换掉**be**，当且仅当被动语态表达事情发生的含义。这种替换一般发生在非正式的口语中。

> [!example]

**get**还有以下表达，虽然是被动语态，但表达的不是被动的含义：
**get married，get divorced，get dressed，get changed，get lost**
