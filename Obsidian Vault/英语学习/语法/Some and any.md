**some**一般用于肯定句，**any**一般用于否定句（也包括形式上不是否定句，但含义是否定的句子）。

> [!example]
> We bought some flowers.
> We didn't buy any flowers.
> Shen went out without any money. (she didn't take any money)

对于疑问句**some**和**any**都是可以的，但含义有所不同：

- 当谈论我们知道的人或事，或我们认为我们知道的人或事，用**some/somebody/something**。
> [!example]
> Are you waiting for somebody? (I think you are waiting for somebody)
- 当我们提供或请求某事时，用**some**。
> [!example]
> Would you like something to eat?
> Can I have some sugar, please?
- 其他情况一般使用**any**，我们不知道人或事的存在。
> [!example]
> I can't find my bag. Has anybody seen it?

我们常在**if**后使用**any**。

> [!example]
> If anyone has any questions, I'll be pleased to answer them.
> Let me know if you need anything.

> [!hint]
> 如果句子含有如果的含义，也用**any**。
> > [!example]
> > Anyone who wants to do the exam should tell me by Friday. (if there is anyone)

**any**有着是哪一个都没关系的含义(**it doesn't matter**)。**anybody**，**anyone**，**anything**，**anywhere**同理。

> [!example]
> You can take any bus. They all go to the center.
> We forget to lock the door. Anybody could have come in.

**somebody/someone/anybody/anyone**都是单数词，但是在它们之后用**their/they/them**来指代。

> [!example]
> Someone has forgotten their umbrella.
