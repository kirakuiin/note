如果介词后（**in/for/about**）后跟随着动词，那么动词要加**ing**。

> [!example]
> Why don't you go out instead of sitting at home all the time.

> [!hint]
> **preposition + somebody doing something**也是一种可用的句型。
> > [!example]
> > I'm fed up with people telling me what to do.

> [!summary] before -ing and after -ing
> 除了**before/after -ing**，也可以用**before/after somebody did**。
> > [!example]
> > Before going out.
> > Before I went out.

> [!summary] by -ing
> **by + -ing**表达的是某事如何发生的概念。
> > [!example]
> > She made herself ill by not eating properly.

> [!summary] without -ing
> > [!example]
> > We ran ten kilometers without stopping.

**to**是一个特殊的介词，因为它经常被用到不定式里，如果是不定式则动词不需要改为**ing**形式，如果充当的是介词成分，则要改为**ing**形式。

> [!example]
> We decide to travel by train. (infinitive.)
> I prefer driving to traveling by train. (preposition.)
