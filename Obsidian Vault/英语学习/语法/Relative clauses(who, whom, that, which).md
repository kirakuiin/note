从句是句子的一部分，一个关系从句告诉我们说话者在说哪个人或事。

![[Relative clauses(who, that, which) 2024-01-06 18.37.49.excalidraw]]

如果从句讨论的是人，那么使用**who**或者**that**。

> [!example]
> We know a lot of people who live in the country.
> The woman that lives next door is a doctor.

---

当你讨论的是事，可以用**which**或**that**。(**that**更加常用)

> [!example]
> Where is the cheese that/which was in the fridge?

当从句修饰的对象是从句的主语时，**who/which/that**是不能省略的。当从句修饰的对象是从句的宾语时，**who/which/that**可以省略。

> [!example]
> The key (that/which) you lost is mine.

> [!hint]
> 如果是人作为宾语，此时也可以使用**whom**。并且此时动词后的介词可以提前到**whom**前。这是一个正式用语，平时很少用。
> > [!example]
> > I like the people with whom I work.
> > I like the people whom I work with.

关系从句中的介词不会再接名词性的成分。

> [!example]
> Do you know the woman Tom is talking to? (not with her).

---

**what** = the thing(s) that

> [!example]
> Did you hear what they said.
