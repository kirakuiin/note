最高级形态以**est**结尾或使用**most**修饰，一般来说短单词用**est**，长单词用**most**。规则和[[Comparison|比较级]]相同。

> [!example]
> What is the longest river in the world?
> What was the most enjoyable holiday you've ever had?

> [!hint] 不规则变化
> **good** -> **best**
> **bad** -> **worst**
> **far** -> **furthest**

一般我们会在最高级前加**the**。

> [!example]
> This hotel is the cheapest in town.

表示某个地方中，组织或一群人中的某人的最高级时，最高级后用**in**。

> [!example]
> What's the longest river in the world.
> Who is the youngest student in the class.

对于一段时间，最高级后用**of**。

> [!example]
> Yesterday was the hottest day of the year.

**old**的最高级是**oldest**，**eldest**只用于谈论家里的某人。

> [!example]
> My eldest son is 13 years old.
> That church is the oldest building in the town.

最高级后经常使用[[Present perfect|现在完成时]]。

> [!example]
> What's the most important decision you've ever had to make.
