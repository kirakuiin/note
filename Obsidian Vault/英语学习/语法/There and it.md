**There ...**  = 第一次谈论某事存在。

> [!example]
> There's a new restaurant in Hill Street.
> I'm sorry I'm late. There was a lot of traffic.

> [!hint]
> 作为副词有在某个地方的含义。
> When we got to the party. There were already a lot of people there (= at the party).

**it** = 一个特定的事，地点，事实或场景。

> [!example]
> We went to the new restaurant. It's very good.

对比两者：

> [!example]
> I don't like this town. There's nothing to do here. It's a boring place.

> [!hint]
> 这种句型没有真正的主语，be动词挨着谁就跟谁保持单复数一致即可。

你也可以说**It/there will/must/might/used to be etc ...**。过去时则是**It/there must/should have been etc...**。其中**there**和**it**的含义和上一节是一样的。

> [!example]
> They live on a busy road. There must be a lot of noise from the traffic.
> They live on a busy road. It must be very noisy.

另一种表达是**it/there is sure/bound/likely to be**。

> [!example]
> There's sure to be a flight to Rome tonight.
> There's a flight to Rome tonight, but it's sure to be full.

当我们形容某些事物，谈论天气，时间，距离时，可以用**it**当作形式主语。

> [!example]
> It's dangerous to walk in the road.
> How far is it from here to the airport.
> What day is it today.
> It was windy yesterday.
