**enough**可以用在名词前。也可以单独使用。

> [!example]
> I don't have enough energy.
> We don't need to stop for petrol. We've got enough.

常用句式：
- **enough/too ... for somebody/something**
- **enough/too ... to do something**

> [!example]
> That shirt is too small for you.
> She's not old enough to have a driving licsence.
> The bridge is just wide enough for two cars to pass each other.

如果句式表达的含义是由于过于/不足导致无法做到某事。此时最后不加代词。

> [!example]
> These boxes are too heavy to carry. (without it)
> This chair isn't strong enough to stand on.
