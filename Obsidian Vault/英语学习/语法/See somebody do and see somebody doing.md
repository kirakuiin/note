当我们在过去看到某人做了某事，使用**I saw somebody do something**。

![[See somebody do and see somebody doing 2023-12-09 11.47.02.excalidraw]]

> [!example]
> I saw Tome get into his car and drive away.

> [!hint]
> 如果在被动语态中，我们使用**seen to**。
> > [!example]
> > He was seen to get in the car.

当我们在过去看到某人正在做某事，使用**I saw somebody doing something**。

![[See somebody do and see somebody doing 2023-12-09 11.50.27.excalidraw]]

> [!example]
> I saw Kate waiting for a bus.

> [!summary] do和doing的主要区别
> 使用一般时代表你完整的看到了整个动作，从开始到结束。而使用进行时则代表你看到了某人正在做某事，这不代表着你看到了动作结束。

以下动词都可以采用这个结构：
**see hear feel smell notice find listen**

> [!example]
> I didn't hear you come in. (you came in - I didn't hear this.)
> I could hear it raining. (It was raining - I could hear it.)
