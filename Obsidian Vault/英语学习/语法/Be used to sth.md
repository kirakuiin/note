**Be/get used to sth** = 习惯于某事。

> [!example]
> I bought some new shoes. They felt a bit strange at first because I wasn't used to them.

> [!hint]
> 这种形式后面不能使用不定式。如果出现**to**，则**to**充当的是介词成分。
> > [!example]
> > She is used to driving on the left.
> > We are not used to the noise.

> [!hint]
> 注意同[[Used to]]的区别。
