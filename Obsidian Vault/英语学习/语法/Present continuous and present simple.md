现在进行时主要用于事情发生在当下时间点附近且没有结束的事情：
![[Present continuous and present simple 2023-10-17 12.46.44.excalidraw]]

而一般现在时用来表示某事一直如此或者不断重复：




> [!info] I always do and I always doing
> I always do 意味我一直做某事。
> > [!example]
> > I always go to work by car.
> 
> I always doing 意味着我经常做某事。
> > [!example]
> > I always playing computer games.
