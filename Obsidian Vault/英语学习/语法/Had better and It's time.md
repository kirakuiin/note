I **had better** do something的含义是建议你去做它，如果不做可能以后有问题。用于现在和将来，而不是过去。

> [!example]
> We'd better stop for petrol soon. The tank is almost empty.
> You don't look very well. You'd better not go out tonight.

**had better**和[[Should]]的含义类似，但不完全相同：

- **had better**针对的是一个特殊的场景，[[Should]]用于所有情况。
> [!example]
> It's late. You'd better go. / You should go.
> You're always at home. You should go out more often.
- **had better**含有如果你不做会有问题的含义，[[Should]]没有。
> [!example]
> The film starts at 8.30. You'd better go now or you'll be late.
> It's a great film. You should go and see it.

**It's time** (for somebody) to do 的含义是是时候做某事了。

> [!example]
> It's time to go home.

**It's time** + (we went/I did/we were) 表达的是现在该做某事了，含有早就该做但未做，现在为时已晚的意思。

> [!example]
> It's late. It's time we went home.

**It's (about) time** somebody **did** something 含有过去应该做但没做，经常用于抱怨和批评。如果加了**about**则让批评的含义更强烈了一些。

> [!example]
> It's time he realized that he isn't the most important person in the world.
