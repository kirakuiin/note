**both, neither, either**均只能描述两个事物，它们的后面可以加名词。代表两者都，两者都不，任一均可的含义。(**neither**，**either**后谓语动词为单数)。

> [!example]
> Both restaurants are very good.
> Neither restaurant is expensive.
> We can go to either restaurant.

> [!hint]
> 这三个词也可以单独使用。
> > [!example]
> > Do you want tea or coffee? Either.

这三个词后也可以加**of**，结构为**both/neither/either + of + the/these/my etc.** (**neither of**后谓语动词单复数均可)。

> [!example]
> Both of these restaurants are very good.

> [!hint]
> **both**后，**of**不是必要的。
> > [!example]
> > Both my parents are from Egypt.

> [!hint]
> 这个结构后也可以加**us/them/you**。此时必须加**of**。
> Both of us were very tired.

这三个词还有语法结构：

> [!summary] both ... and
> Both Chris and Paul were late.

> [!summary] neither ... nor
> Neither Chris nor Paul came to the party.

> [!summary] either ... or
> She's either Spanish or Italian.
