比较级一般有两种形式：

- 形容词/副词+**er**。适用于单音节词。
- **more** + 形容词/副词。适用于其他情况。

比较词后可以加**than**来指明被比较的对象。

> [!example]
> It's cheaper to drive than go by train.
> Going by train is more expensive.

> [!hint]
> 对于以**ly**结尾的副词，使用**more**比较形式。
> > [!example]
> > Can you walk a bit more slowly?

> [!hint]
> 部分双音节形容词可以使用**er**和**more**。尤其是：
> **clever narrow quiet shallow simple**
> > [!example]
> > Can we go somewhere quieter / more quiet.

> [!hint]
> 一些形容词副词的比较级变化是不规则的。
> **good/well** -> **better**
> **bad/badly** -> **worse**
> **far** -> **further**
> > [!example]
> > He did every badly in the exam, worse than expected.
> 
> **further**还有更多，额外的含义。
> > [!example]
> > Let me know if you hear any further news.

在比较级前可以加以下限定词：
**much, a lot, far, a bit, a little, slightly, any, no**

> [!example]
> Let's go by car. It's much cheaper.
> I'm not waiting any longer.
> This hotel is better than the other one, and it's no more expensive.

---

可以重复比较级(**better and better**)来表达某事持续的改变。

> [!example]
> Your English is improving. It's getting better and better.

---

**The ... the better** = 越xxx越好。

> [!example]
> When you're traveling, the less luggage you have the better.

**The ... the ...** = 某事依赖于另一件事。

> [!example]
> The warmer the weather, the better I feel.

---

**old**的比较级是**older**，但当你谈论你的家人时，你可以用**older/elder**来描述他们，比如**elder sister/brother**。

> [!example]
> My elder sister is a TV producer.

> [!hint]
> **elder**不用于比较级。
> > [!example]
> > My sister is older than me. (not elder)

---

**not as/so ... (as) ...** = 没有像 ... 那样 ...。

> [!example]
> Jack isn't as old as he looks. (he looks older than he is)
> It's not warm, but it isn't so cold as yesterday.

> [!hint]
> **less ... than** 和 **not as ... as**含义类似。
> > [!example]
> > I spent less money than you.

在肯定句和疑问句中，我们也使用**as ... as**。

> [!example]
> I'm sorry I'm late. I got here as fast as I could.

> [!hint]
> 这个句式前面可以加倍数，次数来形容。比如**twice as ... as**，**three times as ... as**。
> > [!example]
> > Their house is about three times as big as ours.

**the same as** = 和...一样。

> [!example]
> David is the same age as James.
> Laura's salary is the same as mine.

**than me** = **than I am** = 比我如何。

> [!example]
> You're taller than me.
> You're taller than I am.
