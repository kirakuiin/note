关系从句有两种类型，一种是告诉我们讲话者所说的是哪一个人或事，什么类型的人或事，参考[[Relative Clauses (whose, where)]]和[[Relative clauses (who, whom, that, which)]]；另一种则是我们已经知道讲话者说的是什么了，从句给我们提供了关于它的额外信息。

> [!example]
> We stayed at the park hotel, which a friend of ours recommended.

第二种情况下用逗号分隔主句和从句。这个情况下**that**不能对人和事使用。**where**，**whose**可以使用，**who**和**which**，**whom**不能省略。

> [!example]
> John, who speaks French and Italian. (not that)
> This morning I met Chris, Whom I hadn't seen for ages.
> Lisa, whose car had broken down, was in a very bad mood.

额外信息关系从句可以讲介词提前到**whom**（对人）和**which**（对物）之前。比如**to whom / without which / etc**。

> [!example]
> Mr Lee, to whom I spoke at the meeting.
> Fortunately we had a good map, without which we would have got lost.

> [!hint]
> 非正式英语一般还是用**who**和**which**，并且介词在动词后。

对于[[All and all of#^all-of|All of]]结构的短语(还有**both of / neither of / either of / one of / etc**)。在额外信息从句中其后必须为**whom/which**。

> [!example]
> Two men, neither of whom I had seen before.
> They have three cars, two of which they rarely use.

> [!hint]
> 也可以使用**the case of which / the name of which**。
> > [!example]
> We stayed at a beautiful hotel, the name of which I can't remember now.

对于下列这种句式，必须用**which**，此时**which** = **the fact that ...**。

> [!example]
> Joe get the job, which surprised everybody.
> The weather was good, which we hadn't expected.
