当某事和现在的事实相反；或我们想象某事未来不会发生，或者没想到它要发生，或使用**If** + past。表达的含义是关于现在的。

> [!hint] 现在时
> 如果你用**If** + present。则表达的是你认为它可能发生。

> [!example]
> If you were in my position, what would you do?
> What would you do if you won a lot of money?

当谈论过去的事时，使用**if + had + 过去分词**的形式。

> [!example]
> If I had been hungry, I would have eaten something.

我们用**wish** + past表达我们遗憾某事和我们预料的不一致。其过去式的形式也和**if**类似，**wish had done**。

> [!example]
> I wish I knew Joe's phone number.
> Do you ever wish you could fly?
> I wish I'd known that Gary was ill. I would have gone to see him.

> [!hint] were
> 在**wish**和**if**之后，was可以用were来替代。

在**if**从句里和**wish**后一般不会使用**would**。在**if**的主句里可以使用，还可以用**wouldn't/might/could**。

> [!warning] 过去时**if**从句和**wish**后不能用would have

> [!example]
> If we went by bus, it would be cheaper.
> If I won a lot of money, I might buy a house. (possible)
> If I had seen you, I would have said hello.
> I wish I had something to read.
> > [!hint] 特例
> > 你要求某人做某事的时候可以**if**从句里可以用**would**。
> > > [!example]
