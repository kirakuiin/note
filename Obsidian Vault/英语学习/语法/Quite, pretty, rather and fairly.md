**quite/pretty/rather/fairly** 后可以加形容词或副词，意为*相当*。它的含义要大于*有点*(a little)，小于*非常*(very)。

> [!example]
> It's quite cold.
> It's pretty cold.
> It's rather cold.
> It's fairly cold.

**quite**和**pretty**含义类似，但**pretty**不太正式，一般用于口语。
**quite**还有以下用法：
- **quite** + **a/an** + noun.
- **quite** + **a lot (of ...)**.
- **quite** + verb, 特别是**like/enjoy**.

> [!example]
> It was quite a surprise.
> There were quite a lot of people at the meeting.
> I quite like tennis.

**quite**也有完全的含义。特别是修饰以下形容词的时候：

**sure right true clear different incredible amazing certain wrong safe obvious unnecessary extraordinary impossible**

> [!example]
> Are you sure? Yes, quite sure.(completely sure)

**quite**后也可以接动词来表达完全的含义。

> [!example]
> I quite agree with you.

> [!hint]
> **not quite** = **not completely**。
> > [!example]
> > I don't quite understand what you mean.

**rather**同**quite/pretty**类似，我们常将其用于消极的想法(某事我们认为不好的)；或是某个带有令人惊讶意味的积极的想法。

> [!example]
> Paul is rather shy. (shyness is not good)
> These oranges are rather good. Where did you get them?

---

**fairly**的含义弱于其他三个词，如果你说某事**fairly good**，这表明此事不是非常好，还可以更好。

> [!example]
> My room is fairly big, but I'd prefer a bigger one.
